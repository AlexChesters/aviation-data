# aviation-data
npm package to provide access to static aviation data (e.g. airfields, aircraft names)

## Scripts
The [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory contains scripts which should be ran manually:
* [`airport-data/generate.js`](scripts/airport-data/generate.js) - this Node.js script is used to generate the airport
data (uses the CSV files from [Our Airports](https://ourairports.com/data/))
